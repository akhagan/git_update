title: Tracking Changes
teaching: 20
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How do I record changes in Git?"
- "How do I check the status of my version control repository?"
- "How do I record notes about what changes I made and why?"
objectives:
- "Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files."
- "Explain where information is stored at each stage of that cycle."
- "Distinguish between descriptive and non-descriptive commit messages."
keypoints:
- "`git status` shows the status of a repository."
- "Files can be stored in a project's working directory (which users see), the staging area (where the next commit is being built up) and the local repository (where commits are permanently recorded)."
- "`git add` puts files in the staging area."
- "`git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository."
- "Write a commit message that accurately describes your changes."

First let's make sure we're still in the right directory.
You should be in the `puzzles` directory.

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
/home/lemaster/Desktop/puzzles
~~~
{: .output}

If you are still in `playlist`, navigate back up to `puzzles`

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
/home/lemaster/Desktop/puzzles/playlist
~~~
{: .output}
~~~
$ cd ..
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about our puzzle that depicts the Red Planet.
We'll use `nano` to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier. But remember, the bash command to create or edit a new file will depend on the editor you choose (it might not be `nano`). For a refresher on text editors, check out ["Which Editor?"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/) in [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

~~~
Sorted out the border pieces.
~~~

`mars.txt` now contains a single line, which we can see by running:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
mars.txt
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Sorted out the border pieces.
~~~
{: .output}

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and then check that the right thing happened:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   mars.txt

~~~
{: .output}

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Start notes on Mars puzzle"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars puzzle
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
~~~
{: .output}

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit]({{ page.root }}/reference#commit)
(or [revision]({{ page.root }}/reference#revision)) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`.
Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

[Good commit messages][commit-messages] start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the
changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>.
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~
{: .output}

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

~~~
$ git log
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Puzz le Master <PuzzleMaster@puzzle.box>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Start notes on Mars puzzle
~~~
{: .output}

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

> ## Where Are My Changes?
>
> If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `mars.txt`.
> That's because Git saves information about files' history
> in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
> so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
> (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).
{: .callout}

Now suppose le Master adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Sorted out the border pieces.
Separated pieces by dominant color.
~~~
{: .output}

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

~~~
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Sorted out the border pieces.
+Separated pieces by dominant color.
~~~
{: .output}

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Add notes about sorting interior pieces"
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add notes about sorting interior pieces"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[master 34961b1] Add notes about sorting interior pieces
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding bibliography entries,
but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [changeset]({{ page.root }}/reference#changeset)
but not yet committed.

> ## Staging Area
>
> If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
> `git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot
> (putting things in the staging area),
> and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and

![The Git Staging Area](../fig/git-staging-area.svg)

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll add another line to the file:

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Sorted out the border pieces.
Separated pieces by dominant color.
Am missing a corner piece!
~~~

--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@

+Am missing a corner piece!
~~~
{: .output}

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

~~~
$ git add mars.txt
$ git diff
~~~
{: .language-bash}

There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.
However,
if we do this:

~~~
$ git diff --staged
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index 315bf3a..b36abfd 100644

it shows us the difference between
the last committed change
and what's in the staging area.
Let's save our changes:

~~~
$ git commit -m "List missing pieces"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

check our status:

~~~

and look at the history of what we've done so far:

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):
